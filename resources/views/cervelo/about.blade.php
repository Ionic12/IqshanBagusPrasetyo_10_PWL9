        <p>For more than two decades the goal at Cervélo has been simple: Design and engineer the world’s fastest bikes. Whether you’re a Grand Tour racer, Ironman champion, age-grouper or Saturday morning enthusiast, we know you demand the best in order to achieve your personal best – and we’re passionate about helping you get there.</p>

        <p>Before Vroomen and White’s rationale could be validated by results, the UCI introduced strict rules regarding frame design, making the Baracchi probably one of the most famous race bikes never to be ridden professionally. ‘It did cement in Phil and Gérard’s minds the approach Cervélo should take, though,’ says McDermott. ‘So they started making aluminium frames with airfoil shapes.’ Before long they produced the Eyre road bike, then the P2 TT bike followed, a UCI-legal spiritual successor to the Baracchi. It would go on to win many races, justifying the efficacy of the ideas that went into Cervélo’s bold first bike.</p>

        <p>What began as a university project kick-started the aero road bike market, and Cervélo is still trying to make riders quicker 25 years on. Anyone with an interest in bikes knows that Cervélo was founded in 1995 by Phil White and Gérard Vroomen. However, the duo had been working together behind the scenes for many years before that. ‘Actually, “studying” is probably a more accurate way to describe what they were doing,’ says Sean McDermott, Cervélo’s director of projects. ‘Gérard was making a carbon frame as an engineering project at McGill University in Canada.</p>

        <p>While McDermott dismisses the suggestion that those good times came to an end, they certainly changed form considerably in the early 2010s. Global expansion put strain on every facet of the brand. In the space of a couple of years, Cervélo TestTeam morphed into Garmin-Cervélo, Vroomen left, and White sold to Pon Holdings, a Dutch company involved with several other bike brands such as Raleigh, Focus and Santa Cruz. White was Pon’s chief innovation officer until 2017, and then he too moved on. <br><br>McDermott says the departure of both founding members was felt keenly, but also allowed Cervélo to modernise. ‘Gérard’s was a very slow transition out – he remained as a consultant and visited frequently. Then when Phil left he tasked us with upholding Cervélo’s original tenets. We have a core of long-serving engineers, which is a huge source of pride for us, so those principles were hardwired into them anyway, but we had to develop a structure to work together more as a team. We became more professional and ended up in a stronger position.’</p>
